Hi there! My name is Taylor Henderson and this website will keep all sorts of posts about me.

<b>Professional</b>

Current Role:
Lead CPQ Consultant with Canidium
Each day I learn about the needs of clients and figure out how these can be met by leveraging business software. Specifically, I work with teams to design and implement a system that automates the quoting process through configuration and pricing rules and automatic document generation. This work typically involves close attention to integration with other software such as CRM and ERP systems.
