I recently replaced the driver's side CV axle in my 2014 Subaru Crosstrek. For several months I had been hearing a consistent clicking on the driver's side while making sharp left turns at low speed. I purchased the OEM part from a Subaru affiliated mechanic and worked on the job in the garage.
<br/>
After borrowing or buying all the tools I would need I got the old axle nut loose with a breaker bar and the jack handle and loosened all the lug nuts to take the wheel off. There were then two bolts that held the knuckle on, one of which had an alignment indicator (possibly for the wheel camber?). These proved quite difficult to break loose, although this may have been due to my laziness in using a socket that wasn't quite the right size. Eventually after both these came free I moved on to the task of getting the old axle out of the differential, which required a ball joint puller. I yarded on this fairly hard, but the risk of damaging something else was pretty minimal.
<br/>
I got the old axle out and began to try to fit the new one into the differential. The steps for installing the axle are basically the reverse of the steps to uninstall. I lined up the splines so that I could feel it turning the gears in the differential, but the new part just would not slide in all the way. I greased the splines again and tried more force, eventually resorting to hammering on the wheel end. I was initially hesitant about doing this because I thought it would damage the new axle, but I saw at least one video that suggested that this might be necessary. Hammering away the part still didn't move any further into the differential. After getting frustrated I finally decided I would replace the retaining ring clip on the new axle assembly with the one from the old one. 
<br/>
Viola! Success! The new part slides into the differential and I am able to put the rotor through the other end. My hammering had deformed the metal at this end, so I had to hand file the edges down in order to thread the axle nut on. Everything else goes on fairly easily. After a quick test drive all is nice and quiet on those left turns.

I completed the project over about 3 days working off and on. The OEM part cost around $400 and the quoted price for the job was about $680. I spent maybe $50 to $100 on some tools and consumables. Comparing the money I saved to the time and aggravation, but also the knowledge and skill gained, made this a worthy DIY project.
